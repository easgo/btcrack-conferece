# WiFi Radio Signal Mimicker and Conversations Simulator

This project is a fun experiment that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model
 to mimic WiFi radio signals and generate simulated conversations.

## Installation

To use this project, you will need an API key for OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language
 model. Once you have your API key, simply clone this repository and install the
 required dependencies:

``
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wifi-radio-simulator.git
cd wifi-radio-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the WiFi radio signal mimicker and conversations simulator, run the
 following command:

``
python main.py
```

You will be prompted to enter a message that you want to simulate as a WiFi
 radio signal. The program will then generate a simulated conversation based on
 the message using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model.

## Example

Here's an example of what a simulated conversation might look like:

``
Input message: Can you hear me now?

WiFi radio signal:
SSID: HappyHacker
Signal Strength: 85%
Frequency: 2.4 GHz

Simulated conversation:
Person 1: HappyHacker, this is Base Station. We hear you loud and clear. What's
 your status?
Person 2: Hey Base Station, this is HappyHacker. I'm doing well, thanks for
 asking. Just checking in to make sure my signal is coming through.
Person 1: Roger that, HappyHacker. Your signal strength is at 85% and your
 frequency is 2.4 GHz. Everything looks good on our end.
Person 2: Copy that, Base Station. Thanks for the update. HappyHacker out.
```
